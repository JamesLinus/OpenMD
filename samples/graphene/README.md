This is a sample illustrating united-atom (UA) propylene monomers confined between 
and all-atom (AA) representation of graphene sheets. The force field is
based partially on OPLS-AA, and partially on TraPPE-UA

Propylene parameters from: C.D. Wick, M.G. Martin, and J.I. Siepmann,

 of linear and branched alkenes and of alkylbenzenes,"

Note that the molecule definition in graphene.inc includes bonds that
span the box boundaries.  If you want to extend to
