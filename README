OOPSE

OOPSE is an open-source Object-Oriented Parallel Simulation Engine.
It is primarily used to perform molecular dynamics simulations on
"strange" atom types that are not normally handled by other simulation
packages.  This includes atoms with orientational degrees of freedom
(point dipoles, sticky atoms), as well as transition metals under the
Embedded Atom Method (EAM) or Sutton-Chen (SC) potentials. 

Simulations are started in OOPSE using a single Molecular Dynamics (.md)
file.   These files must start with the <OOPSE> tag and must 
have two sections:

  1) a C-based <MetaData> section, and 

  2) a <Snapshot> block for initial coordinate and velocity information.

Detailed descriptions of the structures of these files are 
available in the "doc" directory.  Sample simulations are 
available in the "samples" directory. 

What you need to compile and use OOPSE:

 1) Good C, C++ and Fortran95 compilers.  We've built and tested OOPSE
    on the following architecture & compiler combinations:

    Architecture                CC     CXX     F90     Notes
    -------------------------   ----   -----   -----   ----------------------
    ix86-pc-linux-gnu           icc    icpc    ifort   (Intel versions 7-9)
    i386-apple-darwin8.7.1      icc    icpc    ifort   (Intel version 9.1)
    powerpc-apple-darwin8.7.0   gcc    g++     xlf95   (GNU v.4 / IBM XL v. 8.1)
    x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu    gcc    g++     pathf95 (GNU v.4 / Pathscale 2.5)
    sparc-sun-solaris2.10       cc     CC      f95     (Sun ONE Studio 10)
    
    We've also successfully compiled OOPSE with the Portland Group c, c++, 
    and Fortran95 compilers on the  x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu architecture.
  
    OOPSE uses features of the Fortran 95 language. The fortran
    portions of our code will not compile if your compiler does not
    support these particular features. Some (but not all) Fortran 90
    compilers do support these features. None of the Fortran 77
    compilers can be used to compile OOPSE.

    Fortran compilers that are known to fail on OOPSE: g77, Gfortran, 
    Older Portland Group compilers (pgf77, pgf90).

    Fortran compilers that are known to work on OOPSE: Intel's ifort,
    Pathscale's pathf95, IBM's xlf95, Portland's pgf95 (version 6 or
    higher), Sun's f95. There may be others that work also.

 2) GNU make (also known as gmake).  Regular make won't work.  
    Really.  We've tried.  Don't bother with regular make.  
    Seriously.  You need GNU make.  Did we mention that you 
    need GNU make?

 3) Perl.  Compilation dependencies in Fortran95 are somewhat
    complicated, so the build process uses a perl script called
    filepp to do this job.  You need perl for filepp, so you
    need perl to build OOPSE.

 4) MPI is optional for the single processor version of OOPSE, 
    but is required if you want OOPSE to run in parallel. 

    We like Open MPI.  Other implementations might work, but we
    haven't tried.  You can get Open MPI here: http://www.open-mpi.org/

INSTRUCTIONS

 1) Get, build, and test the required pieces above.
 2) ./configure  (or ./configure --with-mpi=/usr/local/openmpi)
 3) make
 4) make install

That's it.
